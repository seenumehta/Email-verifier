# Email-verifier

This repository contains a Python script for validating email addresses based on specific criteria.

## Email Validation Script

The script checks if the email address meets the following conditions:
1. The email length must be at least 6 characters.
2. The email must start with an alphabet.
3. The email must contain "@" exactly once.
4. The "." character must appear either at the third or fourth position from the end.
5. The email must not contain spaces, uppercase letters, or any special characters other than "_", ".", and "@".
